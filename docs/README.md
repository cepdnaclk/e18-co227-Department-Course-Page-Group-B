## Overview
---

After graduating most of the students are seeking opportunities for higher studies. The Computer Engineering Department of the University of Peradeniya also  offers many postgraduate courses for those students. Currently, the available web page is not flexible and it is not very detailed. So, the main intention of this project is to design a very detailed course page for postgraduates. 

## Problem
---

The available course page contains only the research-based postgraduate courses. Although the department does not offer any teaching postgraduate courses, the department is planning to offer around 25 teaching postgraduate courses including technical electives in near future. So, the department is in a need of a new postgraduate course page. 

## Proposed Solution
