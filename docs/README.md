## Overview
---

After graduating most of the students are seeking opportunities for higher studies. The Computer Engineering Department of the University of Peradeniya also offers many postgraduate courses for those students. Currently, the available web page is lack of details about the courses and conetent coverage. So, the main intention of this project is to design a very detailed course page for postgraduates. 

## Problem
---

The available course page contains only the research-based postgraduate courses. Although the department does not offer any teaching postgraduate courses, the department is planning to offer around 25 teaching postgraduate courses including technical electives in near future. So, the department is in a need of a new postgraduate course page. 

## Proposed Solution
---

- develop a very informative web site to keep course information
- separate web page for each course
- detailed course page with statistical data(total registered students, grading average in previous years etc)


## Features
---

Main features of a course page are,

  - Course Description
  - Course Plan (Lecture/Lab/Tutorial hours and breakdown)
  - Course Modules
  - ILOs
  - Prerequisites
  - Credits
  - Lecturers with details (may be changed from time to time)
  - Reference Books
  - Grade distribution


## Technology Infrastructure
---

  - HTML/CSS/Java Script - Used to develop and style the frontend
  - Jekyll               - Used as a static site generator
  - Json                 - Used to store the data
  - GitHub Pages         - Used to host the Web Page
